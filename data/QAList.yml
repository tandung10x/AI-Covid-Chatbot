conversations:
- - What is coronavirus?
  - Coronavirus is a family of viruses that typically cause 
    mild respiratory infections like the common cold, but also 
    more severe (and potentially deadly) infections. They are 
    zoonotic diseases, meaning they are transmitted from animals to people.
- - How can I protect myself from being Covid 19?
  - Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 2 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick. 
    Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible. 
    Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. 
    Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination. 
    Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. 
    Limit going out when not necessary.
- - Why is it called coronavirus?
  - Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word corona, meaning 
    “crown” or “halo,” because they have “crown-like spikes on 
    their surface,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
    and Prevention.
- - What severe diseases are caused by coronavirus?
  - A coronavirus that originated in China led to the Severe Acute 
    Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Another coronavirus 
    emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, causing Middle East Respiratory 
    Syndrome (MERS).
- - What’s the difference between coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19?
  - The novel coronavirus responsible for this outbreak is known as 
    SARS-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is called COVID-19.
- - why does covid-19 cause loss of smell
  - Some patients can temporarily lose their sense of smell. This is because
    the “hook” of cells used by SARS-CoV-2 to latch onto and infect cells 
    is up to 700 times more prevalent in the olfactory-supporting cells 
    lining the inside of the upper part of the nose than in the cells 
    lining which necessary for the function of odor-sensing cells.
- - Why does Covid 19 cause shortness of breath?
  - COVID-19 can cause damage to the lungs that impedes their ability to 
    remove oxygen from the air. A lot of patients develop what’s known as 
    severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- - Is Covid 19 worse than the flu?
  - Yes. COVID-19 is much deadlier than the flu. COVID-19 has a higher 
    severe disease and mortality rate than influenza in all age groups, 
    except perhaps children under the age of 12.
- - Are there at-home Covid tests available?
  - It’s now possible for people to buy tests at their local pharmacy. 
    These are rapid antigen tests—you get your results in 20 minutes. 
    And if you test positive with those, you should isolate. You should not 
    be around other people, because you’re probably contagious.
- - If I test positive for Covid on an at-home test, what should I do?
  - If you test positive using an at-home test, you should follow-up with 
    your health care provider and follow the instructions on your test kit 
    to report your results to the local health department. You should isolate 
    in your home according to CDC guidelines and reduce contact with anyone 
    living in your household.
- - Is hand sanitizer effective to protect against Covid 19?
  - If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that 
    contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub 
    them together until they feel dry.
- - Does wearing a mask protect me from getting sick?
  - There is growing evidence that wearing masks protects the wearer as well as others. 
    Masks—no matter what kind of mask—filter out the majority of viral particles.
- - What should I do if I am fully vaccinated and exposed to Covid?
  - Fully vaccinated people who have come into close contact with someone 
    with suspected or confirmed COVID should be tested 3-5 days after exposure 
    and wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days or until they 
    receive a negative test result.
